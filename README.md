# Crystals Collector

Welcome to the game of collecting crystals!

In this game, you are an international jewel thief.

Your goal is to steal the crystals, but you must be careful.

If you take too many, the FBI will hunt you down.

If you don't take enough, you won't have enough money to pay the debts you incurred from your student loans.

* You collect crystals by clicking on them.

* There are four crystal types to choose from; yellow, teal, red, and purple.

* Each crystal is worth a random value, from 1 to 15 points.

* This value is hidden from you, until you collect the crystal.

* Once collected your score will go up by the value of the crystal.

* Collect enough crystals to meet the value of your target number, but do not exceed the value or it's off to jail for you. And by jail I mean you lose the game... you don't actually go to jail.

* If you meet but do not exceed your target, you win!

* You still have those debts to pay off, but you got away with the crystals!

* Each time the game starts, the target number changes.

* Wins and losses are tallied up as you play.
